# ids-broker-lib

ids-broker-lib is a javascript library to control / interact with [IDS Metadata Broker](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/metadata-broker-open-core).

The library is implemented in TypeScript, but can be either used by Javascript or TypeScript. The client is implemented for server-side use with Node and uses node-fetch as the request library.

## Installation

```bash
npm i ids-broker-lib
```

## Credits

The typescript models and services in this library have been initially generated from the official OpenAPI Spec with the help of [openapi-typescript-codegen](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen) and then have been further modified.
